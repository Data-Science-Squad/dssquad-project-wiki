Our [DS Squad Slack workspace](https://app.slack.com/client/T01L8K09T9B/C01LQAMKKDF) is our primary communication platform. Use our Slack workspace to send messages to the group, @mention team members, send direct messages, and share files.

Trello is our Kanban-style tool for organizing and displaying the tasks we are working on, tasks that need to get done, and which team members are working on them. Use our [Trello Task Tracker Board](https://trello.com/b/Sy7HIaCH) to help the team stay informed and monitor our progress.
