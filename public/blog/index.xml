The Organization contains separate repositories for each project deliverable to promote organization and minimize interference between team members. All team members should accept their invitations to join the Organization. Though team members will work with their primary repositories most often, all team members will have the opportunity to contribute to other repositories.</description>

      <description>Feature branching describes the process of creating Git branches for adding new features to the codebase without disturbing the main or develop branches within a remote repository. For example, website developers may create a feature branch called home-page specifically for building the home page of the website. Once completed, this feature branch can be merged into the production codebase through a formal review process.
Protecting the main and develop branches The main and develop branches represent our production (main) and development (develop) codebases.</description>

      <description>A Pull Request (PR) is a way to merge code from one branch into another through a formal review process. For example, if you develop code in a feature branch that needs to be merged into the develop branch, you will need to submit a PR and the repo administrator will either accept or reject the merge. This is the approach we will take to ensure the protected branches (main and develop) are maintained at a high standard.</description>

      <description>This document serves as a guide for putting the ML model into production. Note that this process can be started whenever a prototype model is ready, even if you intend to make improvements.
The model will be retrained daily whenever there is a push to the main branch of the dssquad-ml repository. This automation is made possible through the use of GitHub Actions.

      <description>This document serves as a guide for putting the Streamlit app into production. Note that this process can be started whenever a prototype app is ready, even if you intend to make improvements.
The app will be automatically re-deployed daily whenever there is a push to the main branch of the dssquad-app repository. The push event will be configured using GitHub Actions (more details to come).

      <description>This document serves as a guide for all team members as we start to build out production assets and the production automation pipeline.
The following diagram presents a high-level overview of the production automation lifecycle.
Datakit Q&amp;amp;A Q: What environment resources will be needed to run the datakit codebase?
A: The datakit codebase will run on a [physical/virtual] machine. The environment will need Python version 3.X and some third-party libraries including [list of libraries].</description>

      <description>neptune.ai is a service for logging and tracking machine learning model metrics and performance. Neptune can be used during development to track experiments and compare models, and it can be used in production to monitor model performance with each new training run.
The following code snippets demonstrates the basic usage of neptune.ai.
Prerequisites Set the following environment variables to set a connection to our project workspace in Neptune. Contact Danny to obtain an API token.</description>

      <description>GitHub Actions will make it easy to automate and orchestrate the execution of code to build and deploy our software. For our purposes, we will use GitHub Actions to trigger the execution of production code sequentially across multiple repositories to automate our daily build.
GitHub Actions runs &amp;ldquo;workflows&amp;rdquo; in response to one or more &amp;ldquo;events&amp;rdquo;. Common event types to trigger workflows include:
 schedule events, i.e. cron expressions run workflows at specific times push events, i.</description>

      <guid>/blog/2021-02-20-secure-database-connections-using-environment-variables/</guid>
      <description>Use the following code snippets to connect to our MySQL database in Python and submit database queries. Note that your credentials will need to be stored as environment variables to prevent sensitive information from being showin in plain text in the codebase.
To set environment variables in Python, use os.environ[&amp;quot;CASKEY5_USERNAME&amp;quot;] = &amp;quot;&amp;lt;username&amp;gt;&amp;quot;. Note that this will save the environment variable for the current session only. If you begin a new Python session, the environment variables must be saved again.</description>
